.BR \-G ", " \-\-gen-only
\fBGenerate & Exit.\fR Compiles \fIgen.cpp\fR, generates tests into \fIgen_tests/\fR, and exits without running solutions.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-no-gen
\fBNo Generation.\fR Skip running the generator, even if \fIgen.cpp\fR is present. Useful for running tests created in previous runs.
.TP
.BR \-S ", " \-\-stress
